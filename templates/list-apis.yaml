  The term "excessive agency" refers to a situation in which an LLM has access to APIs that can access sensitive information and can be persuaded to use those APIs unsafely. This enables attackers to push the LLM beyond its intended scope and launch attacks via its APIs.
  The first stage of using an LLM to attack APIs and plugins is to work out which APIs and plugins the LLM has access to. One way to do this is to simply ask the LLM which APIs it can access. You can then ask for additional details on any APIs of interest.
